## COVID-19 X-Ray Image Classification

This project focuses on the classification of COVID-19 x-ray images into pneumonia or normal cases using deep learning models. The key highlights of this project include:

- Data preprocessing: The dataset is prepared for model training and testing.
- Data augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, shift, and flip are applied to enhance the dataset.
- Model building: Two models are constructed, one utilizing the VGG16 pre-trained model and another using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
- Model training: The models are trained on the prepared dataset.
- Evaluation: The models are evaluated on a separate test dataset.
- High accuracy: Both models achieve high accuracy in accurately distinguishing between pneumonia and normal cases.
