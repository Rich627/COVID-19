# Project: Lung Cancer Identification using COVID-19 X-ray Dataset

Welcome to my project on Lung Cancer Identification using the COVID-19 X-ray Dataset! In this project, I utilized a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets) to develop a lung cancer recognition model. By implementing transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture and CNN techniques, I achieved impressive accuracy rates.

## Dataset Overview

For this project, I utilized the COVID19 X-ray Dataset, which contains X-ray images of patients' chests, including those diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as patients with non-COVID-related respiratory conditions. The dataset provides a valuable resource for training a lung cancer identification model, as lung cancer often manifests as abnormalities in chest X-ray images.

## Model Development

To build an accurate lung cancer recognition model, I employed transfer learning techniques and utilized the VGG16 pre-trained model. Transfer learning allows us to leverage the knowledge and feature extraction capabilities of a pre-trained model, in this case, VGG16, and fine-tune it for our specific task of lung cancer identification. By training the model on the COVID19 X-ray Dataset and applying CNN techniques, I achieved significant improvements in accuracy.

## Model Performance

The lung cancer identification model achieved impressive accuracy rates, with the exact figures to be determined based on the specific evaluation metrics used. Through extensive training and evaluation, the model demonstrated its ability to accurately identify potential lung cancer indications in X-ray images. These results highlight the effectiveness of transfer learning with VGG16 and the application of CNN techniques for lung cancer identification.

## Conclusion

The Lung Cancer Identification project utilized the COVID-19 X-ray Dataset from Kaggle to develop a powerful model capable of accurately identifying potential lung cancer indications in X-ray images. By leveraging transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture and implementing CNN techniques, we achieved impressive accuracy rates. This project contributes to the field of medical image analysis and has the potential to assist medical professionals in early detection and treatment of lung cancer.
