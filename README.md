Use of deep learning models for classifying COVID-19 x-ray images as pneumonia or normal. 
It includes data preprocessing, data augmentation, model building (using VGG16 and a custom CNN), model training, and evaluation.
The models achieve high accuracy in distinguishing pneumonia cases from normal cases
